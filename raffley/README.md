# Raffley üéüÔ∏è

A real-time raffle application built with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView. This project demonstrates modern web development patterns including real-time user presence, live updates, and interactive UI components.

## Features

- **Real-time Raffles**: Create and manage charity raffles with live updates
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system
- **Live Presence**: See who's currently viewing each raffle in real-time
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative interface for managing raffles and drawing winners
- **Ticket System**: Users can purchase raffle tickets with comments
- **Charity Integration**: Support for multiple charitable organizations
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **Elixir** - Functional programming language
- **Phoenix Framework** - Web framework for Elixir
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time, interactive web applications
- **Phoenix PubSub** - Real-time messaging and presence tracking
- **Ecto** - Database wrapper and query generator
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.16+ 
- Phoenix 1.7+
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js (for asset compilation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```
3. Start the Phoenix server:
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```
   Or inside IEx:
   ```bash
   iex -S mix phx.server
   ```

4. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser

### Database Setup

The `mix setup` command will:
- Install Hex and Rebar dependencies
- Create and migrate the database
- Install Node.js dependencies for assets
- Run database seeds
